Where you live
Your rank in League of legends. Not that impressive, really.
How much you suck in bed.
Your bank account balance.
Your credit card number.
All your passwords.
That embarassing thing that happened in first grade which you still think about all the time.
How much you suck at Zed. Seriously dude, stop.
You secretly love your neighbour.
You don't visit your grandmother often enough. Really? She misses you!
You could stand to lose a few pounds.
You're cheating on your SO with a drag queen. Good for you.
You're secretly gay.
Your phone number.
You should be studying right now.
In reality, you're really ugly. It's just that everyone is too polite to tell you.
That time you stole from your friend's house. You monster.
